On February 11, in honour of Black History Month, we proudly flew our inaugural Black History Celebratory Flight to acknowledge and highlight the continued contributions of Black employees to our airline and the aviation industry.

From planning right through to operations, the flight from Toronto to Fort Lauderdale and back was flown by a Black crew and supported by Black employees on the ground and behind the scenes. As a global airline that connects Canada to six continents, diversity is fundamental to our success, and it is vital that our customers see themselves and their cultures in us.
