    "# Why Python?\n",

    "The question might as well be \"why programming language(s)?\", but the answer remains pretty much the same.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Some people think of corpus linguistics as the action that starts with the analysis of a corpus of texts: data is selected, collected, and processed, and only then does corpus linguistics begin. This is a narrow view and one that [should be broadened] by incorporating into corpus approaches those technical notions and procedures that define what corpus data is.\" (Di Cristofaro 2023:1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Approaching digital textual data should therefore be inclusive of everything that concerns data processing, or - to summarise - of *digital technicalities*\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"that is, those notions and mechanisms that – while not classically associated with natural language – are i) foundational of the digital environments in which language production and exchanges\n",
    "occur and ii) at the core of the techniques that are used to produce, collect, and process the focus of investigation, that is, digital textual data. (Di Cristofaro 2023:4)\n",
    "\n",
    "This does not however mean that we should become computer scientists nor expert coders, but rather\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"to acquire a degree of proficiency with the ‘digital language’ sufficient enough to ensure that no disconnect is present among the digital data, the corpus itself, and the methods through which it is investigated and interpreted – even when the person who collects the data is not the same one who conducts the analysis. (Di Cristofaro 2023:15)\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact we must not forget that\n",
    "> \"data processing is as relevant as data analysis; even more, it might be argued that the former is more crucial than the latter. Knowledge of how to use corpus tools and of the underlying theories is paramount to guarantee a scientifcally valid analysis and should never be overlooked or ignored. This can, however, be learnt or improved along the way during the analysis of the data once the corpus has already been created. Data from the web, on the contrary, does not usually permit this fexibility: ensuring that what a researcher needs for their analysis is correctly collected may be a one-time chance, not replicable in the future.\" (Di Cristofaro 2023:72)"

    "# Cooking with Python: a culinary analogy\n",
    "Let's pretend you have just bought a new apartment in Italy, and that it comes pre-furnished. In it you have a kitchen, a basic one; let's pretend it's a *basic Italian kitchen*. A kitchen where you will find all the tools and ingredients that are needed to prepare basic Italian dishes: an oven, a stove, some pans, some cutlery; pasta, salt, pepper, olive oil, tomatoes, onions, garlic.  \n",
    "You won't find Garam Masala in it, nor sushi rice, nor a wok. Just a basic Italian kitchen to get you started with Italian dishes.  \n",
    "The default Python installation is just like this kitchen: it has the basic tools and ingredients (called **modules** or **libraries**) and nothing more.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Now, you have invited some friends over for an Indian dinner, and you are going to prepare a Tikka Masala curry. Your basic kitchen doesn't have a lot of the things needed - some of which are commonly available from any store in Italy, some others that can only be found in specialised stores. Chicken and yoghurt can easily be found in any supermarket; curry spices and coconut milk must be bought in Asian markets. \n",
    "Similarly in Python you may need to get some **modules from \"outside\" as they are not available in the basic installation**; this is commonly done through a module manager called [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).  \n",
    "\n",
    "What if one of your guests is coeliac? Well, you'd have to get some special ingredients, as well as using tools that must not come in contact with non-gluten-free ingredients. You would have to keep these ingredients and tools separate from the other ones, since mixing them may cause serious consequences: the former are conflicting with the latter.  \n",
    "The same may happen with Python modules: you may be using a module that requires specific versions of other modules, which in turn may be incompatible with another module. Luckily with Python you can create a **virtual environment** (often called `venv`), a self-contained and isolated \"box\" into which you can install modules and keep them separated from modules installed inside of a second virtual environment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So our next step is to install Python through `conda`, a package manager which simplifies the installation of modules as well as the creation of virtual environments."

    "# Emoji transliteration\n",
    "Emojis pose a number of issues when working with corpus tools (AntConc, SketchEngine, LancsBox, LancsBox X, WordSmith, etc...) since they are often not fully supported (yet). The reason is extremely complex, but the consequences are straightforward: corpus tools don't \"see\" emojis as we humans do, and - more often than not - miscount and misrepresent them. This leads in turn to a skewed corpus and skewed results.  \n",
    "For example, the following \"sentence\" is interpreted by us as composed of 3 different emojis, while corpus tools may interpret them in various ways, including seeing 6 (or more) emojis.\n",
    "\n",

    "- [Ninja: Medium-Light Skin Tone](https://emojipedia.org/ninja-medium-light-skin-tone)\n",

    "> 👩 Woman + 🏿 Dark Skin Tone + 🦰 Red Hair  \n",
    "> 🥷 Ninja + 🏼 Medium-Light Skin Tone  \n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid issues - and have a corpus as faithful as possible to the original data - we may *transliterate* emojis into their CLDR, thus turning each emoji into a \"bundle of words\" that contain their official descriptions; e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 👯‍♂️ -> {men_with_bunny_ears}\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax used for the description is applied so that the corpus tool doesn't interpret each word of the description as a token, but rather treats the `{men_with_bunny_ears}` as a single (unknown) token.  \n",
